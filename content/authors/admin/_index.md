I am a machine learning engineer at Data Revenue GmbH. I designed and developed end-to-end machine learning systems for medical researchers. I am also a founder of Dataginjo LLC where I worked with clients in online education and recreation industries to apply machine learning and predictive modeling in marketing and operation areas. My interests include reinforcement learning and time-series forecasting. 

Before moving to the U.S., I worked with VNET Venture Capital, one of the leading venture capital management companies in Thailand. My focus was on identifying investment opportunities in IT, retail, healthcare, and food industries. 

I published research articles on Quantitative Finance and Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting. But now I am focusing on artificial intelligence in marketing. 

I enjoy beer, cooking, SCUBA diving, and looking at soccer stats
